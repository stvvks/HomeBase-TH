# Task 1: Terraform Module

# Create a Terraform module that accomplishes the following:

# - Creates an S3 bucket configured for hosting a public website.

# - Balances configurability with maintainability. This means making design decisions that ensure the module is easy to use and maintain while still allowing for some level of customization if needed.

# Please feel free to note any assumptions or design decisions you make during this task.

 

# Task 2: Dockerfile

# Write a Dockerfile that can build and run the Ruby sample application from the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/pioneerworks/ruby-sample-app) in a production environment. Ensure that the Dockerfile is suitable for deploying the application in a real-world scenario.

# Again, if any assumptions or decisions are made during this task, please make a note of them.

# This assignment is expected to take less than 2 hours, and we believe it will provide valuable insights into your technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Once you have completed the tasks, please share your work with us ahead of the interview in a format that is convenient for you, such as a GitHub repository or a ZIP file containing your code and any necessary documentation.

# To build & execute, run a docker build -t "image name" .
# Then a docker run -p 8080:8080 "image name"
